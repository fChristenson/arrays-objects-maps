# Arrays Objects and Maps

## What we will cover

* What is an array?
* What is a 2D array?
* What is a associate array?

## Notes

"Array" is the name we gave "list" in JavaScript.

A "2D array" is the name we commonly use to describe a array of arrays.

An associate array is another name for a "Object" in JavaScript but objects can do more than
store keys and values.

A map is similar to a object but is meant to only provide a way to store keys and values just
like how we commonly think about a associate array.
